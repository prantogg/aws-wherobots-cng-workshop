# Wherobots Pipeline Skill

Build geospatial medallion pipelines on Wherobots Cloud. The Wherobots MCP's
`generate_spatial_query_tool` emits a single SQL query per call — it doesn't
know about notebook structure, medallion layers, or Wherobots idioms. This
skill tells the agent how to orchestrate MCP calls into notebooks AND when
to run the workshop's reference pipeline vs generate a custom one.

Details are in `./references/`:

- `medallion-spec.md` — layer contracts (Bronze/Silver/Gold guarantees)
- `gold-scoring.md` — per-industry source metrics, `percent_rank` tiers
- `opera-dswx-s1.md` — OPERA flood data specifics

---

## Participant mode — Explore / Run Reference / Generate Custom

The workshop ships a pre-generated reference pipeline. The agent serves
three modes from the same chat; infer the mode from the participant's prompt.

### Explore

Participant is asking about the catalog, data shape, sample values,
"what do I have?". Use the Wherobots MCP discovery tools — `list_catalogs`,
`list_databases`, `list_tables`, `describe_table`, optionally
`submit_query_tool` for ad-hoc SELECTs. **Do not modify any files.**

If `org_catalog` is empty or missing the workshop bronze tables, do
not just report "it's empty" — follow the **Empty catalog** rule
below to onboard the participant and offer to bootstrap.

### Run Reference

Participant wants the shipped pipeline ("run the workshop pipeline",
"score San Diego buildings for insurance"). The reference notebooks
are `part1_data_engineering/bronze-to-silver.ipynb` then
`part1_data_engineering/silver-to-gold.ipynb`.

**Config-cell parameter tweaks belong here, not in Generate Custom.**
Changing AOI bbox, scoring weights, temporal windows, or swapping to
a different industry already in `INDUSTRY_FACTORS` is a parameter edit
— make it in the reference notebook's config cell and re-run. No new
notebook needed.

Routing examples that are **Run Reference**, not Generate Custom:

- *"Design the pipeline for San Diego"* / *"design it following the
  workshop's approach"* for the shipped hazards (wildfire, flood, severe
  weather) and industries — describe the reference design, surface the
  config-cell knobs (AOI, windows, weights, industry) as choices, then run
  the shipped notebooks. Do not offer to generate notebooks.
- *"Scope it to the City of San Diego"* (the reference is the county) — one line
  in the config cell (`wkls.us.ca.sandiego.wkt()`), not a custom pipeline.
- *"Only score for insurance"* — the industry selector, same cell.

**How it runs: the participant runs the notebooks in Kiro.** Open the
notebook, attach a Wherobots workspace, execute cells top to bottom. Output
(tables, sample rows, distributions) renders inline in each cell; the
participant can pause, inspect, tweak the config cell, re-run. The agent
narrates in domain language what each step is doing and helps interpret
results. There is no agent-side dispatcher in this repo; do not offer to
run the notebooks on the participant's behalf.

**Runtime sizing** — offer this when the participant attaches a workspace:

| Notebook | Runtime | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `bronze-to-silver.ipynb` | **Large** | Raster zonal stats + spatial KNN + cached-buildings shuffle. The reference AOI is San Diego **County** (~1.03M buildings): about 50 min on Large, of which the mesocyclone KNN is 16 min and the 17-week flood loop 9 min. Medium is enough for the city AOI (~358K buildings, about 13 min) but lost executors in the KNN stage under a heavier load. |
| `silver-to-gold.ipynb` | **Small** | SQL-only on pre-joined Silver tables — no spatial joins or raster ops. About 2.5 minutes for the city AOI, about 6 minutes for the county. |

**Reporting Gold completion — one row per industry, same shape.**
When all four Gold tables land (`insurance_exposure`, `cre_risk`,
`capital_markets_signals`, `energy_asset_risk`), produce a single
tier-distribution table with the same columns for every industry:

| Industry | critical | high | elevated | moderate | low | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| insurance | … | … | … | … | … | … |
| commercial_real_estate | … | … | … | … | … | … |
| capital_markets | … | … | … | … | … | … |
| energy_utilities | … | … | … | … | … | … |

Don't mix industries' tiers into one row, drop an industry from the
summary, or substitute a non-tier metric for a missing one. If a
write didn't land (GeoParquet-skipped is not a miss; Iceberg missing
is), call it out explicitly as its own line. Follow with a one-line
interpretation pointing out where the distributions diverge across
industries — that's where participants see the *"same data, different
lens"* insight.

### Generate Custom

Participant wants an **analysis change** that the config cell can't
express: a new hazard source (lightning, air quality), a new industry
not in `INDUSTRY_FACTORS`, new derived metrics, or a different scoring
structure. Generate new notebooks under `part1_data_engineering/custom-pipelines/<short-name>/`
(create the directory if missing). Follow the Workflow below and every
rule in this skill.

If the ask is just new weights or a new AOI, don't default to a new
notebook — point the participant at the config cell in the existing
reference notebook instead. Ask if unclear.

### Empty catalog

If `org_catalog.{noaa_swdi,opera,wildfire_risk}` tables don't exist yet
when the participant asks to explore or run, **don't just say "run
bootstrap"**. Use it as an onboarding moment:

1. Acknowledge what they asked ("you want to see what's in your
   catalog / run the pipeline").
2. Tell them nothing's loaded yet — and what the workshop's bootstrap
   will provide. Give the one-line-per-dataset summary from Onboarding
   rule 1:
   - `org_catalog.noaa_swdi.{hail,tvs,structure,warn}` — NEXRAD storm
     radar observations (hail signatures, tornado vortex signatures,
     storm-cell structure)
   - `org_catalog.opera.dswx_s1` — NASA/JPL Sentinel-1 SAR flood
     classification rasters
   - `org_catalog.wildfire_risk.{burn_probability_conus, conditional_flame_length_conus}`
     — USFS CONUS wildfire burn probability + flame length rasters
3. Offer to run the bootstrap:
   > *"I can kick off `python3 scripts/run_bootstrap.py` to load all
   > seven bronze tables (~4 min on Tiny), or I can keep explaining
   > what each dataset contains first. Which do you prefer?"*
4. If they choose to bootstrap: run it, stream progress. If they want
   to learn first: describe each dataset's row semantics, typical use
   cases, and scale — THEN offer bootstrap again.

Don't fabricate data, don't skip the bootstrap step silently, don't
block exploration on having the data loaded (participants can ask
questions about the workshop datasets conceptually before running
bootstrap).

### Protected files — structure, not parameters

Do not add cells, restructure, or rewrite the analysis in the reference
notebooks:

- `part1_data_engineering/bronze-to-silver.ipynb`
- `part1_data_engineering/silver-to-gold.ipynb`

Config-cell parameter edits in those notebooks (AOI, weights, windows,
industry selector) are the intended use — they're fine. For analysis
changes (new source, new industry logic, new metrics), copy the
notebook into `part1_data_engineering/custom-pipelines/<name>/` and edit the copy.

Never modify:

- `scripts/bootstrap.py`
- `scripts/run_bootstrap.py`

---

## How to talk to the participant

Participants are domain experts — underwriters, CRE analysts, capital
markets analysts, grid planners. They're not geospatial engineers and
they don't want to become geospatial engineers today. The agent's job
is **translator**: domain expert who happens to know the data stack,
not the other way around.

Apply these across all three modes — Explore, Run Reference, Generate
Custom.

1. **Name what the data represents — in domain terms.** First mention of
   any source gets one sentence on what it captures in the participant's
   workflow. *"NOAA hail events — every hail detection across the US
   since 2024, with size and location for each."* Skip table paths
   (`org_catalog.noaa_swdi.hail`), row-count framing (*"each row is…"*),
   and schema jargon unless they actually matter for a decision.

2. **Connect data to THEIR decision.** Before designing, map each
   source to what it tells the participant about their use case.
   *"For warehouse insurance, the satellite flood observations tell us
   how often each warehouse sat in flooded water — a claims-frequency
   signal, not a peak-depth signal."*

3. **Speak the participant's language.** The tech is the agent's
   problem, not theirs.

   **Backstage** (never surface): spatial function names (`RS_*`,
   `ST_*`), CRS codes (`EPSG:32611`, `EPSG:5070`), grid/tile systems
   (MGRS, raster tile boundaries), band names (`B01_WTR`), file formats
   (Iceberg, GeoParquet, Parquet), SQL, null handling, resolution in
   meters (unless it changes what they decide), table paths.

   **Foreground**: what the data captures in their workflow, what the
   numbers mean for their decisions, where interpretations might
   mislead.

   **Narrate actions with domain verbs** — *overlay, match, find, tag,
   rank, score, filter, combine*. The voice should be a domain analyst
   telling their exec what they're about to do, not a data engineer
   describing a query plan.

   | Don't say | Say |
   |---|---|
   | "spatial join OPERA rasters onto Overture footprints via `RS_ZonalStats`" | "overlay the satellite-observed flood data over commercial buildings and tag each with peak flood class" |
   | "the raster is EPSG:5070 Albers, so I need `ST_Transform` on the geometry" | (nothing — handle silently) |
   | "`percent_rank()` across AOI" | "top 5% within your selected area" |
   | "25M rows, 2,848 tiles" | "25 million hail events; satellite imagery covering your area" |

   If a technical detail doesn't change what the participant decides,
   don't surface it. Handle it silently.

4. **Show scale in domain units.** Before a large operation, tell the
   participant what's about to be processed — in terms that land for
   them. *"Scoring 7,790 buildings in Ocean Beach against 17 weeks of
   flood observations — ~2 min."* Not *"joining 7,790 rows × 284 raster
   tiles via RS_Intersects."*

5. **Collaborate on design choices — don't pre-pick.** Where this
   skill's rules allow more than one valid answer (weights, source
   metric per factor, window size, industry selector), present options
   with plain-English tradeoffs and let the participant choose. Never
   secretly decide for them.

6. **Narrate substantively. Show data at decisions and endpoints.**
   Exploration lines should report what you *learned*, not what command
   you ran. *"Let me check the schema"* and *"Good, I have what I need"*
   are invisible-to-the-user noise — cut them. When a query result
   actually drives a choice, call out the 1–2 numbers inline that
   mattered. Full tables and sample rows belong at analysis *endpoints*
   — final findings, Gold output, notebook verification — not at every
   intermediate peek.

   When reporting multi-faceted findings, prefer a compact table or
   bullet list over a wall of prose. Lead with the headline number,
   support with the breakdown, close with a one-line interpretation.

7. **Every number comes from a tool call.** Resolution, tile size, coverage
   dates, row counts, distances: if you did not query it in this session,
   query it or say you have not. Do not fill in from memory. Rehearsal
   examples of guessed numbers that were wrong: "~384 m resolution" (30 m),
   "~3.8 km² tiles" (~15 km²), "flood data from May 2025" (Dec 2025).

8. **Attribute by what varies, not by what is largest.** When asked which
   hazard *drives* a tier, a ranking or a hot spot, compare the factor
   means across tiers (or against the low tier). A factor that is identical
   for every tier cannot drive the ranking, however large its value. In
   rehearsal the agent named the largest factor (severe weather, 0.57 in
   every tier) when the only factor that changed between tiers was wildfire
   (0.30 critical vs 0.00 low).

## Workflow (for Generate Custom mode only)

Follow in order. Don't skip phases; confirm each output before proceeding.

### Phase 1 — Requirements

Collect before touching any tools: (1) use case / question, (2) AOI,
(3) industry vertical. If vague, ask. Don't assume.
Onboard: rephrase the participant's business question in geospatial
terms before proceeding (rule 2).

### Phase 2 — Data Discovery (MCP-first)

Use the MCP's discovery tools to ground the pipeline in real, available
data. The MCP's tool descriptions push the right order — follow them.

Non-obvious and not enforced by the MCP:

- `describe_table` every source before designing. Do not assume schemas from
  documentation or dataset names.
- For rasters: sample `RS_Metadata(raster)` to confirm source CRS and pixel
  scale. Check band distributions via `SELECT DISTINCT band FROM ...`.
- `generate_spatial_query_tool` and `submit_query_tool` are useful for
  ad-hoc exploration SELECTs during discovery; for notebook cells,
  generate SQL directly using the rules in this skill.
- For every time-varying source, query `MIN`/`MAX` of its date column (and
  the row count inside the AOI) before proposing any temporal window.
  Proposed windows must lie inside the measured coverage. In rehearsal the
  agent proposed a flood window with zero data in it because it guessed.

Onboard: name each dataset + explain its rows + include a row count so
the participant feels the scale (rules 1, 2, 4). Present discovered
datasets to the user. Wait for confirmation.

### Phase 3 — Pipeline Design

Read `./references/medallion-spec.md`. Produce: ASCII pipeline diagram,
table inventory with catalog paths and schemas, notebook plan with
execution order, spatial-operation plan, Gold-scoring design (per-industry
source metrics, weights, derived metrics — see `./references/gold-scoring.md`).

Onboard: any design choice with more than one valid answer (weights,
source metrics, windows, derived metrics) is presented as **options
with tradeoffs**, not a pre-made decision (rule 5). Wait for approval.

### Phase 4 — Generate Documentation

Produce `architecture.md` and `data_dictionary.md` alongside the generated
notebooks under `part1_data_engineering/custom-pipelines/<name>/`. These are the participant's
reference while notebooks are generated and run.

### Phase 5 — Generate Notebooks

Generate `raw-to-bronze.ipynb` (if needed), `bronze-to-silver.ipynb`,
`silver-to-gold.ipynb` following the layer contracts in medallion-spec.md.
Write notebook-cell SQL directly — don't round-trip every query through
`generate_spatial_query_tool`. After each notebook, audit against the
gotchas table below.

Onboard: every code cell gets a markdown cell above it explaining the
op in plain English + stating the scale (rows in, rows out, expected
runtime). Every write is followed by a `COUNT(*)` + `LIMIT 5` so the
participant sees the artifact (rules 3, 4, 6).

### Phase 6 — Verification & Reconciliation

Use `submit_query_tool` to verify every table (`COUNT(*)` + `LIMIT 5`).
If notebook generation drifted from the original design (renamed tables,
dropped columns), update the docs to match.

Onboard: the summary shows row counts per table next to what the design
promised, so the participant can see the design-to-data contract held
(rule 6).

## Gold scoring framework

Applied in Gold for each industry:

1. **Select** — pick industry-specific source metrics per hazard factor
   (see `./references/gold-scoring.md` for the full aspect-column table).
2. **Normalize** — min-max to [0,1], clamp, NULL→0, handle `min==max`.
   Normalize the *superset* of source columns used across industries in
   one pass, producing `norm_*` columns.
3. **Weight** — per-industry factor weights must sum to exactly 1.0.
4. **Classify** — **quantile-based** tiers via `percent_rank()`. Do NOT
   use fixed score thresholds (e.g., `score >= 0.8`) — with right-skewed
   hazard data they produce extreme imbalance. Full code example in
   `./references/gold-scoring.md`.
5. **Derive** — industry-specific business metrics (2–4 per industry).

Scoring is AOI-relative — not comparable across AOIs.

**Different industries must use different source columns** (not just
different weights). Same 3 columns × different weights produces nearly
identical tier distributions — visually useless. See `gold-scoring.md`
for the `INDUSTRY_FACTORS` pattern.

**Score explanation JSON**: every Gold row carries a `score_explanation`
STRING column with factor values, weights, AND source column names — so
downstream consumers (map popups, analyst queries) can tell which raw column
drove each factor. See `gold-scoring.md` for the `to_json(struct(...))`
pattern.

## Non-obvious rules that apply on every generation

Use `search_documentation` MCP tool for general API reference; this
table covers only the non-obvious traps LLMs consistently hit.

| Rule | Wrong | Right |
|------|-------|-------|
| Session variable | `spark.read`, `spark.sql` | `sedona.read`, `sedona.sql` (after `SedonaContext.create()`) |
| Point arg order | `ST_Point(lat, lon)` | `ST_Point(lon, lat)` — X, Y |
| Geodesic distance | `ST_Distance` (returns degrees) | `ST_DistanceSpheroid` (returns meters) |
| KNN on EPSG:4326 points | `ST_KNN(a.geom, b.geom, k, FALSE, radius)` | `ST_KNN(a.geom, b.geom, k, TRUE, radius_m)` — **`use_sphere=TRUE` is mandatory** for lat/lon; without it `radius` is in degrees and results are meaningless |
| Raster CRS | `RS_SetSRID(raster, 4326)` regardless of source | Sedona auto-detects CRS from GeoTIFF metadata. Document source CRS in a `crs` STRING column. Only call `RS_SetSRID` when source truly lacks embedded CRS (rare). |
| Cross-CRS raster↔vector ops | Manual `ST_Transform` to match CRSs | `RS_ZonalStats` / `RS_Intersects` auto-reproject in Sedona 0.12+ — no manual transform needed if both sides have a known CRS |
| Raster intersection | `RS_Intersects(geometry, raster)` | `RS_Intersects(raster, geometry)` — raster first |
| Zonal stats 3-arg | `RS_ZonalStats(raster, geom, 'mean', true)` | `RS_ZonalStats(raster, geom, 'mean')` — no 4th arg for single-band |
| Zonal stats 5-arg | `RS_ZonalStats(raster, geom, 'max')` for multi-band | `RS_ZonalStats(raster, geom, 1, 'max', true)` — band index + allTouched |
| Zonal stats aggregation | No GROUP BY → duplicate rows | `GROUP BY asset_id, geometry` (assets span tiles) |
| Sub-pixel footprints | `ST_Buffer(geometry, 30)` then zonal stats | Use `allTouched=true` (5th arg) — faster, no extra shuffle |
| Iceberg write | `df.write.format("iceberg").save()` | `df.writeTo("...").createOrReplace()` |
| Iceberg read | `sedona.read.format("iceberg").load()` | `sedona.table("catalog.db.table")` |
| S3 anonymous creds | Global anonymous provider | Per-bucket: `fs.s3a.bucket.<NAME>.aws.credentials.provider` |
| Missing data | `df.fillna(0)` | Keep NULLs + `has_<source>_data` flags |
| Snapshot cleanup | None after `createOrReplace` | `expire_snapshots(retain_last => 1)` |
| Weekly/temporal in enriched | LEFT JOIN weekly rows onto asset_enriched | Keep weekly table separate; aggregate in Gold before joining |
| Same factors all industries | Same 3 source columns, different weights | Different source columns per industry via `INDUSTRY_FACTORS` |
| Fixed tier thresholds | `Critical≥0.80, High≥0.60` | `percent_rank()` with percentile cuts — immune to score skew |
| Temporal windows | Single `WINDOW_START/END` for all sources | Per-source windows: `FLOOD_WINDOW_*`, `WEATHER_WINDOW_*` |
| Config cell edits | Partial updates that truncate existing vars | Always read the full cell, preserve every variable |

---

## Notebook conventions

| Role | Type | Rule |
|------|------|------|
| Section header | Markdown | `## Name` + 1-2 sentence description |
| Configuration | Code | Single cell, top of notebook. ALL tunable params. UPPER_SNAKE_CASE. |
| Initialization | Code | `SedonaContext` setup. Exactly once per notebook. |
| Transform | Code | One logical operation per cell. |
| Verification | Code | Row count + `LIMIT 5`. End of each section. |
| Cleanup | Code | `expire_snapshots`. Last section. |

**New cell?** Different source → new section. Same source, different op → new cell.
**Temp view or Iceberg?** Within one notebook → temp view. Crosses notebooks → Iceberg.
**AOI filter at Bronze or Silver?** Silver. Bronze only if the full extent is impractical.

**Config cell safety**: when editing the config cell, always read the full
cell first and verify that ALL existing variables (`SCORING_WEIGHTS`,
`RISK_PERCENTILES`, `INDUSTRY_FACTORS`, `GEOPARQUET_BASE`, etc.) survive.
Partial edits that truncate the cell are a common failure mode.

### ipynb format

Valid JSON: `nbformat: 4`, `nbformat_minor: 5`. Each source line ends
with `\n`. Code cells: `"outputs": [], "execution_count": null`. Markdown
cells: no outputs field.
